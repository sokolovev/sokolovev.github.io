This Privacy Policy applies to the website located at https://adop.co/ (the <strong>“Website”</strong>), the tools made available through the Adoperator Website (collectively the <strong>“Services”</strong>).<br><br>Generally, there are three categories of users of the Services:<strong>“Publishers”</strong> who are operators or publishers of websites and apps;<br>‍<strong>“Advertisers”</strong> who display their content across our platform, and<br>‍<strong>“Users”</strong> who are individuals that use a Publisher’s Website or app.<br><br>When using the Website along with any other services as may be offered vide the Website (collectively the “Site”) and submitting any personal and non-personal information to us, you agree and grant us the right to use your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h2>What information we collect?<br></h2>

We will collect the Personal Information that you submit to us when using the various information submission boxes and forms located within the Site.<br><br>‍<strong>Personal Information</strong> is data about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, credit card number and/or any other information that might be considered private. When you submit inquiries, request information or give us feedback on or in relation to this Site or you register as an Advertiser or Publisher or User, we will ask you for the relevant personal information. We may also ask you to provide other information in connection with your request, such as your location and industry, your preferred means of communication, as well as other information.<strong><br><br>Non-Personal Information</strong> is data gathered by us and/or our partners, so it can be used for the purpose of online retargeting only. Such information is gathered irrespective of whether you sign up for an account or provide us with Personal Information. Non-Personal Information is completely anonymous and includes but not limited to Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser information, date and time of visit, domain type, and other related activity collected through cookies (please read the cookie policy) web beacons and similar technologies, device identifiers etc. None of this information, under any circumstances, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual. If we combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.<br><br>Hereinafter both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information is collectively referred to as “Information”.</p>

This may mean, for instance, that you may receive the same content multiple times rather than receiving new or targeted content. Please note that if you block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly.
